Saturday night and feeling slightly under the weather. Pretty bored. Decided to do Kotlin Koans.

__Task -1:__
Might as well try IntelliJ (not Android Studio). Don't ask me why, I just felt like it. Trying out installing it using brew. Hmmm 403. To the download page then. Australian internet so slow I have time to eat dinner while it downloads.

Cloned the [github repo](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans). Wow lots of stuff in here.

Downloading everything finally finished. I should be able to just open the project, right? Fired up and ready to go!

Hold up, IntelliJ does not think so.
IntelliJ: SDK not set up
Zarah: Should I have imported my Android Studio settings?
Zarah: SDK you mean Java? Oh you say JAVA_HOME is not set. Let me set it.
IntelliJ: ...
Zarah: Just.. Okay did I inadvertently skip a setting screen I shouldn't have?
IntelliJ: SDK not set up

Had to [StackOverflow this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32998437). I have forgotten how difficult it can be to set up an IDE. I hope to never have to change computers.

__Task 0:__
I was asked to read the README. I read the README. Then I read it again. And again. I read the doco in [Task 0](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans/tree/master/src/i_introduction/_0_Hello_World). I sort of don't get it. Maybe it will come to me. Edit: After three hours I finally understood what it was trying to say.

__Task 1:__
That was pretty neat.

__Task 2:__
_"Specify only 'prefix' and 'postfix' arguments."_ This kind of confused me. Do you mean arguments to the method? Right.

__Task 3:__
I don't know how to write an if-else statement. Ooooooh `plus()`! I like this API.

__Task 4:__
Sure I won't "use the class `Iterables`". I don't even know what `Iterables` is in Java. Oh it's Guava!

__Task 5:__
Regex? I'm worse than the worst at this. OMG I correctly guessed it! Time to leave it for the night while I'm still winning!
