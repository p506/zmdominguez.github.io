Today was the day.

Today was the day a thing I worked on was [open sourced](http://tech.domain.com.au/2016/08/tell-me-your-email-addresses-please). It's done. It's out there. My code. For everyone to see. It is like baring my soul to the world. It **is** baring my soul to the world.

You can't possibly imagine how I feel. I am frightened. I am elated.

Will people find it useful? Will they use it? Will they look at my code and laugh at how stupid I am? Will they finally know _for sure_ that I am a ruse? Will they whinge about how I am _Not Doing Things Right_?

And you know what? I don't care. I've done my part and did the best I could.

(I lied. I do care. But I promise I'll try to get over it as soon as I can.)

Be afraid. But still do it.

Massive thanks to the Domain Android team for the support, code reviews, suggestions, feedback, and putting up with my baking frenzies; and to [Mike](http://michaelevans.org/) for the code contributions, and for helping me through the very arduous publishing process.
