Recently, there has been a spate of tweets about developers admitting their weaknesses. A bunch of people I know even made into the <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/836232961037058050">Moment</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev">@ThePracticalDev</a>. And then there's this tweet:<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Hi, I’m aurynn, and even though I’ve been coding for 15 years, as a woman in tech anything less than a display of perfection is a risk <a href="https://t.co/DMYMPTQh1R">https://t.co/DMYMPTQh1R</a></div>— your pocket friend (@aurynn) <a href="https://twitter.com/aurynn/status/835961004022345728">February 26, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> Go ahead and read that whole thread. It's important.<br /><br />Over the last months I have talked to a lot of women in tech, and one thing I realised is that I am not alone.<br /><br />I'm not the only one worried about making a mistake.<br />I'm not the only one who preface everything she says with "You all know this already, but...".<br />I'm not the only one who double-, triple-, quadruple-checks <i>every</i>. <i>single</i>. <i>thing</i> before saying anything.<br />I'm not the only one who constantly worries about being seen as stupid when she asks a question.<br />I'm not the only one afraid to write something for fear of being called a know-it-all.<br /><br />I am not alone.<br /><br />There are people who will feed on your fears. I made a post about a new discovery three days ago. And true enough, I got replies like this:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KdLz4-fJc5o/WLTQzqSzVaI/AAAAAAAA8lo/YnuDElbK1lgNp6pi6jPN7ak6TIiUEt8MgCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-28%2Bat%2B12.20.55.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="110" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KdLz4-fJc5o/WLTQzqSzVaI/AAAAAAAA8lo/YnuDElbK1lgNp6pi6jPN7ak6TIiUEt8MgCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-28%2Bat%2B12.20.55.png" width="320" /></a></div>Uhmmm... Okay... I'm sorry for making you see something you already know. I'll be more careful next time.<br /><br />But then a few hours ago, someone left this comment in one of my posts:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YyarzRcsMHs/WLTOKtudkcI/AAAAAAAA8lY/x0lrdE61uWci7xoQ6GQsw4ISNur63ZSSQCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-28%2Bat%2B11.52.25.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="29" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YyarzRcsMHs/WLTOKtudkcI/AAAAAAAA8lY/x0lrdE61uWci7xoQ6GQsw4ISNur63ZSSQCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-28%2Bat%2B11.52.25.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />And this, my friends, is why despite all our fears, we should never stop sharing.
