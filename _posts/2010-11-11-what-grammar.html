My OC side was alarmed when suddenly, my Problems view in Eclipse was filled with warnings on my XML files.  Each of my XML files had a warning with it, and that little yellow exclamation mark on the side:<div>No grammar constraints (DTD or XML schema) detected for the document</div><div><br /></div><div>So how do you get rid of it?  Go to <code>Window > Preferences > XML > XML Files > Validation</code> then set <code>Indicate when no grammar is specified</code> to <code>Ignore</code>.  Click on Apply.</div><div><br /></div><div>Clean up your project (<code>Project > Clean</code>). </div><div><br /></div><div>If the problem doesn't go away, you may need to re-validate the XML files. Right click on the file then choose Validate from the popup menu.  You can also right click on the folder (such as your <code>res</code> folder) and validate from there.</div>
