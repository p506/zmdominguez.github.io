I gave an unabridged version of my last Android Meetup talk at this year's YOW Conference. It has been an honour being part of this awesome conference!

What wonderful timing to announce being [a part of the Google Developer Experts program](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/zarah-dominguez) too! Thanks to everyone who stayed behind to watch me babble on and on for an hour!
