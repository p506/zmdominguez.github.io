I have a TextView (who doesn't?) and I want to adjust its height automatically, depending on the length of the text it will contain.  Should be easy.  It was, but it took me a couple of minutes to figure it out.<div><br /></div><div>So I want my TextView to be by default one line tall, but be able to expand up to two lines.  My initial set up was to set lines=1 and maxLines=2, but it was making the TextView always two lines.  Not what I wanted!  I went through the documentation again, read each word carefully, and then:<br /><pre class="brush:xml">&lt;TextView android:id="@+id/title"<br />android:layout_height="wrap_content"<br />android:layout_width="fill_parent"<br />android:ellipsize="end"<br />android:maxLines="2"<br />android:minLines="1"<br />android:text="This is the text" /&gt;</pre>So it turned out that you have to set both <code>minLines</code> <b>and</b> <code>maxLines</code>. TADA!</div>
