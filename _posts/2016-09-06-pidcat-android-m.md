If you use [Pidcat](https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat), there might be issues running the tool if your device is on M+. The issue has been [fixed on master](https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat/issues/117) but hasn't been released yet.

The readme says to fix the issue, get the latest off master:

```shell
12:46 $ brew unlink pidcat
Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/pidcat/HEAD... 1 symlinks removed
‚úî ~/Android 
12:48 $ brew install --HEAD pidcat
Warning: pidcat-HEAD already installed, it's just not linked
‚úî ~/Android 
```

That didn't quite work, so let's link it:

```shell
12:48 $ brew link pidcat
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/pidcat/HEAD... 1 symlinks created
‚úî ~/Android 
```

I tried re-running pidcat, but it's still not displaying anything. Which probably means we really don't have the latest code off the repo. The `--force` switch has been deprecated, so to force an update we would have to call `reinstall` instead:

```shell
12:49 $ brew reinstall --HEAD pidcat
==> Reinstalling pidcat
==> Cloning https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat.git
Cloning into '/Library/Caches/Homebrew/pidcat--git'...

==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/pidcat/HEAD: 5 files, 19.5K, built in 4 seconds
‚úî ~/Android
```

Or, if do not want to do all that, you can also do:

```shell
$ adb logcat -v brief | pidcat my.package.name```
