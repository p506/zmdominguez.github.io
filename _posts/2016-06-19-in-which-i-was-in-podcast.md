It has been a month since IO and in case you missed it, I got to chat with [Kaushik](https://twitter.com/kaushikgopal) of Fragmented. And by golly, I made it into an episode! At that point I was about to lose my voice, so I sound really husky. :p

There are some big names in the [episode I am in](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/43/) (I still have no idea why I'm there, but I'll take it!), so please give it a listen!

PS: I travelled quite a bit after IO, but I did start a draft of my recap. I hope it sees the light of day eventually!
