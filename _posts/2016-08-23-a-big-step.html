Today was the day.<br /><br />Today was the day a thing I worked on was <a href="http://tech.domain.com.au/2016/08/tell-me-your-email-addresses-please" target="_blank">open sourced</a>. It's done. It's out there. My code. For everyone to see. It is like baring my soul to the world. It <b>is</b>&nbsp;baring my soul to the world.<br /><br />You can't possibly imagine how I feel. I am frightened. I am elated.<br /><br />Will people find it useful? Will they use it? Will they look at my code and laugh at how stupid I am? Will they finally know&nbsp;<i>for sure</i>&nbsp;that I am a ruse? Will they whinge about how I am <i>Not Doing Things Right</i>?<br /><br />And you know what? I don't care. I've done my part and did the best I could.<br /><br />(I lied. I do care. But I promise I'll try to get over it as soon as I can.)<br /><br />Be afraid. But still do it.<br /><br />Massive thanks to the Domain Android team for the support, code reviews, suggestions, feedback, and putting up with my baking frenzies; and to <a href="http://michaelevans.org/" target="_blank">Mike</a> for the code contributions, and for helping me through the very arduous publishing process.
