I have <a href="http://droidista.blogspot.com.au/2016/02/squashing-bugs.html" target="_blank">previously</a> <a href="http://droidista.blogspot.com.au/2016/02/taking-closer-look-while-debugging.html" target="_blank">written</a> about debugging and how Watches can help make inspecting things in your code easier. Today, I would like to reiterate how powerful Watches can be.<br /><br />When something fails in my code and I'm lucky, I would have a vague idea of what may be causing it. So I launch my app then attach the debugger (<a href="https://twitter.com/zarahjutz/status/695549744983093248" target="_blank">NO! to the green bug!</a>); I am stopped at a breakpoint and while staring at the offending line, a "Wait, what if it's this other thing that's causing it?" pops into my head.<br /><br />If you are used to debugging by peppering your code with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Log</span>s or <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Timber</span>s or <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Toast</span>s (and there's nothing wrong with that!!), you would have to stop debugging, add the logs, and re-launch your app (thank God for Instant Run!).<br /><br />However, we can leverage Watches to make this process a whole lot easier. While stopped at a breakpoint, just add a new Watch (âŒ˜+N or click the&nbsp;+ in the Watches pane) and start typing.<br /><br />Let's say for some reason I wanted to see what Intent extras, if any, had been passed into the current Activity. I just add a new Watch and put in the usual way of getting an Activity's extras -- <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">getIntent().getExtras()&nbsp;</span>and now I can inspect what I have been given when this Activity was launched. Easy peasy.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WobygbPFehA/V1vZ4JLtGuI/AAAAAAAAY6I/Kqw-ZF0PGFEWTZCbIl2Gg4L-DfGhhoDSgCLcB/s1600/watches_context_optim.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="168" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WobygbPFehA/V1vZ4JLtGuI/AAAAAAAAY6I/Kqw-ZF0PGFEWTZCbIl2Gg4L-DfGhhoDSgCLcB/s320/watches_context_optim.gif" style="cursor: move;" width="320" /></a></div><br />Now in the IntelliJ documentation, there is a quote that says:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Watch expressions are always evaluated in the context of a stack frame that is currently inspected in the Frames pane.</blockquote>Similar to the way "context" is defined in the real world (and in the Android world too, I guess) this means that Watches will only make sense if they are in used in the correct circumstance where it can be fully understood. Still confused?<br /><br />Say I am now stopped at a breakpoint in a Fragment (The Frames pane says I am in the method&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">getRandomSublist()</span> in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">CheeseListFragment.java</span>) and I would like to see the extras passed into this Fragment's host Activity. The previously added Watch will not work since in our current context -- that of a Fragment -- there is no such method <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">getIntent()</span>. To do what I want, I would need to call the Activity first -- <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">getActivity().getIntent().getExtras() </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">(</span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">= null,&nbsp;</span>there are no extras received!).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2XoXjHpvHUk/V1vhlNmfItI/AAAAAAAAY6g/DbBBc0rXxvQpXUB2ZjTjuNr8v1_zYqaZACLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-11%2Bat%2B20.01.22.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="155" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2XoXjHpvHUk/V1vhlNmfItI/AAAAAAAAY6g/DbBBc0rXxvQpXUB2ZjTjuNr8v1_zYqaZACLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-11%2Bat%2B20.01.22.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Pretty coooooool. I think in a sense, you can think of Watches as coding without actually coding. Happy debugging!<br /><br /><br />
