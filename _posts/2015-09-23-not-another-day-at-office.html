We had another round of Innovation Day at Domain last month, and <a href="http://tech.domain.com.au/2015/09/innovation-day-august-2015-domain-device-wall/" target="_blank">I wrote about it</a>. We started out dreaming up this ambitious project -- too ambitious for two days! Here's a partial list of what we had to do:<div><ul><li>Build a wall</li><li>Stick devices on said wall</li><li>Make app that cycles through photos from listings</li><li>Load said app on those devices that we stuck to the wall</li><li>Figure out how to track people who get devices</li><li>What if someone just gets a device?!</li><li>Figure out how to let people give back devices</li><li>Oh! oh! oh! Wouldn't it be cool if other devices cheer when one of them "comes home"?</li><li>How do we put new versions of the app on those devices?</li><li>Run tests, maybe?</li><li>What if the website team wants to test responsive designs?</li><li>Do they even charge????!!!</li></ul><div>It was a LOT of work. But it was awesome.</div></div>
